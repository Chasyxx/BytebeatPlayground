    - Note: after saving, check the terminal running BP. you should see true followed by the file path you set. if you see false, the save failed.

The code edit is very rudimentary at the moment
(can't be hidden, no selection or clipboard-related things...)

The stack idea and most commands come from IBNIZ, which somewhat inspired this program.
http://viznut.fi/ibniz https://github.com/viznut/IBNIZ/

Unlike ibniz's 16.16 fixpoint, bytebeat playground uses 32 bit integers.
Numbers are as in IBNIZ, except for that `.` for decimals is not suppourted
+ - * / % & | ^ ~ l d p x, are as in IBNIZ (% or / by 0 returns 0 back)
# is for comments
t pushes t to the stack
_ makes a number negative
x d p and conditionals (...?...; or ...?...:...;) are as in IBNIZ

despite bring in IBNIZ, q, s, and a aren't added yet, and r is shift right instead of rotate right

add ##<filepath> to the begining of your code to save it to that location. e.g:
    ##testfile.bp
    ddAr&/

To load a file, simply add it's name to the command line.
    ./exec testfie.bp
