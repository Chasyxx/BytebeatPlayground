The code edit is very rudimentary at the moment

The stack idea and most commands come from IBNIZ, which somewhat inspired this program.

Unlike ibniz's 16.16 fixpoint, bytebeat playground uses 32 bit integers.
Numbers are as in IBNIZ, except for that `.` for decimals is not suppourted
+ - * / % & | ^ ~ l d p x w \ , are as in IBNIZ (% or / by 0 returns 0 back)
_ makes a number negative
x d p and conditionals (...?...; or ...?...:...;) are as in IBNIZ

despite bring in IBNIZ, q, s, and a aren't added yet, and r is shift right instead of rotate right
