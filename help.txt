F1 - Pause audio
F2 - Reset t to 0
F3 - Resume audio
F4 - skip back 32768 samples
F5 - skip forward 32768 samples

Ctrl+T - Switch between no background and a black background for text.
Ctrl-W - Enable waveform display
Ctrl+S - Save (see line 25)
    - Note: after saving, check the terminal running BP. you should see true followed by the file path you set. if you see false, the save failed.

The code edit is very rudimentary at the moment
(can't be hidden, no selection or clipboard-related things...)

The stack idea and most commands come from IBNIZ, which somewhat inspired this program.
http://viznut.fi/ibniz https://github.com/viznut/IBNIZ/

Unlike ibniz's 16.16 fixpoint, bytebeat playground uses 32 bit integers.
Numbers are as in IBNIZ, except for that `.` for decimals is not suppourted
+ - * / % & | ^ ~ l d p x, are as in IBNIZ (% or / by 0 returns 0 back)
# is for comments
t pushes t to the stack
_ makes a number negative
x d p ! @ and conditionals (...?...; or ...?...:...;) are as in IBNIZ

{ ... } defines a subroutine (Saves a pointer to mem[x] where x is a value popped off the stack)
    eg. `1{d*}` defines subroutine 1 to square a number.

f calls a subroutine using the pointer stored at mem[x] (x was the value popped off the stack).
    eg. `1f` calls subroutine 1.

Quotes define a ConstantString. Every character inside the quotes (quote escaping pssible, to have a literal quote character you'd use \", and for a backslash use \\) is saved and then immeadiately indexed using a value popped off the stack. If the index goes out of range, it wraps around.

Eg. t"Hello world" is equivalent to `"Hello world"[t%11]` in C, or `"Hello world".charCodeAt(t%11)` in JS.


Square brackers defind a ConstantArray. Every index in the array is a two digit hex number (must be two digits and hex). They can be seperated with commas, but they don't have to be.

Eg. [00,01,10,FF] is the same as [000110FF].

Apart from commas, there can't be any other formatting everywhere, or you might get the "Badly formatted hex" or "Badly formatted ConstantArray" errors.
Like a ConstantString, it's then immdeadiately indexed using a value popped off of the stack, wrapping around if out of range.

E. t[48,65,6C,6C,6F,20,77,6F,72,6C,64] is the same as t"Hello world"

despite bring in IBNIZ, q, s, and a aren't added yet, and r is shift right instead of rotate right

add ##<filepath> to the begining of your code to save it to that location. e.g:
    ##testfile.bp
    ddAr&/

To load a file, simply add it's name to the command line.
    ./exec testfie.bp
