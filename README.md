# Bytebeat playground
Inspired by things such as the [Ideally Bare Numeric Impression giZmo](http://viznut.fi/ibniz/) and classial C snippets of bytebeat music (in short, C/JS expressions that generate raw sample data), Bytebeat Playground is a runtime written in C++ for bytebeat music. Most C-compatible bytebeat codes' sounds can be fully recreated in this engine.
